# Polarcape APIs project
- --
### This is my solution to the email sent task by Polarcape, I chose *flask* as the framework and *SQLite* as database. 

### Repo contains:

- app.py (where models and apis live)
- database.db (dummy database file I used) 
- pc-test (postman collection for testing)
- requirements.txt (dependency list file)

### How to run it:

You need to have python 3.7 and Postman(optional) installed.
Then just clone this repo, open it in your IDE and install requirements by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the app just press the run button on your IDE.


I recommend you use Postman to test the API endpoints, the test collection is part of this repo and it will save you time.
all you need to is import it in your Postman run the app and send the requests.

### Thank you.
